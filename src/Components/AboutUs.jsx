              Hello! üëã I‚Äôm <strong className="text-yellow-500">Effat Ara</strong>, a passionate <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> with a love for crafting intuitive and engaging web applications. My journey into programming began with a simple ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù program that sparked a lifelong fascination with technology.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Over the years, I‚Äôve honed my skills by working on diverse projects, from sleek e-commerce platforms to dynamic dashboards, always striving to combine creativity and functionality.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Beyond programming, I enjoy exploring my creative side through <strong className="text-yellow-500">drawing, photography, and singing</strong>. I believe in continuous learning and thrive in collaborative environments where I can share knowledge and grow alongside like-minded professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Curious, proactive, and a team player, I see every challenge as an opportunity to innovate and make a difference. Let‚Äôs connect and create something amazing together!
